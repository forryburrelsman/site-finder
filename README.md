### Overview
As someone who loves to spend time hiking, swimming, camping, and exploring the outdoors, I've always wanted an app that I can use to find cool and nearby sites that I haven't been to before. This app will give users the ability to find locations near them(Missouri only), upload information about their favorite locations, share a bit about themselves, and potentially even find a hiking buddy. 
### Features
<b>User login:</b> Users can create and authenticate an account. Their profile will include a photo and "about me" section.<br>
<b>Add site information: </b>can add locations and include relevant information such as photos, feautures, activities, accessibility, last time they've been there, etc.<br>
<b>Add to existing site: </b>user can add their own information to an existing location.<br>
<b>Add friend: </b>Users can friend each other.<br>
<b>Like a location: </b>Users can "favorite" a location and saves the location to a list specific to each user called "Favorites".<br>
